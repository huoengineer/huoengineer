## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

For software and DevOps development, I always love it.
I am a professional software engineer with 12 plus years of experiences in full stack web & mobile apps development and DevOps in AWS, Azure, Ionos, Godaddy, etc, from 2012. I have been working for many kinds of companies, customers with various environments, various business goals. That means I have strong talented skill sets and full experiences to understand and implement your idea, business model. Mainly I would like to work on full stack web and mobile app (iOS and Android) development as well as DevOps development.
For communication and management of projects, I have the best capability, and I'd like to suggest the best way to implement and improve your idea. The better idea, the more capability.
Thank you. All the best.
